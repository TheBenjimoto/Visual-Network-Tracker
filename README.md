Visual Network Tracker using Wireshark pcap files and Google Maps KML format

After capturing sample data on a local ethernet, the data was then converted to a readable format through python methods and translated into KML, which was then
uploaded onto google maps. The code allows for dynamic data allocation but for educational purposes, only local data was used.
